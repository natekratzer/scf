```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#df <- haven::read_dta("p19i6.dta")
df <- read_csv("SCFP2019.csv")
```

to make this useable I need to translate this SAS code into R
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/files/bulletin.macro.txt

there is a flow chart that gives variable names here
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/files/Networth%20Flowchart.pdf

there appears to be an online codebook for the final dataset that is extremely slow:

```{r}
#recoding some key variables
df_glp <- df %>%
  mutate(age = AGE,
         kids = KIDS,
         labor_forece = LF,
         asssets = ASSET,
         fin_assets = FIN,
         nonfin_assets = NFIN,
         vehicle = OWN,
         debt = DEBT,
         monthly_rent = rent,
         race = case_when(
    RACE == 1 ~ "White",
    RACE == 2 ~ "Black",
    RACE == 3 ~ "Hispanic",
    RACE == 5 ~ "Other",
  ),
  home_owner = case_when(
    HOUSECL == 1 ~ 1,
    HOUSECL == 2 ~ 0
  ),
  married = case_when(
    MARRIED == 1 ~ 1,
    MARRIED == 2 ~ 0
  ),
  educ = case_when(
    
  ))

```
